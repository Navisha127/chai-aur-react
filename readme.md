react dom-web
react native- phone
npx create-react-app 01basic //wrong way,takes too much time,use vite
npm create vite@latest
function should be camel letters in react and vite both
in vite extension should be .jsx unlike react(.js and .jsx both will work)
basic react has scripting but vite doesnt. It runs <script type="module" src="src/main.jsx"></script> in index.html
